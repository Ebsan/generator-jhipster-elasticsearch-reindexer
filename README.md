> JHipster module, Generate a service for reindexing all database rows for each of your entities

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

This module will generate a service using your JHipster entities that allows you to delete and recreate your entity indexes in Elasticsearch, then reinsert all data into the newly created indexes from your main datastore.

This is useful if any changes have been made to the main database outside of the application, like inserting rows using liquibase or migrating data from another database. This can also be used to solve Elasticsearch mapping errors that can be caused by changing a field's type or adding/removing fields.

# Prerequisites

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, so you will need to have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

- [Installing JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/installation.html)

You also need to have created entities using JHipster. The generator will run if you haven't created any entities, but no entities will be added to the generated service. When creating a new project, I recommend running this generator immediately and allowing the post-entity generation hook to run it automatically.

# Installation

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-elasticsearch-reindexer
```

To update this module:
```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-elasticsearch-reindexer
```

# Usage

For **monolithic** applications, or applications using JHipster before microservices were introduced, you only need to follow the instructions below once.

For **microservices and gateways**, you need to follow the directions below for each of your services and gateways. When generating the service for gateways, only reindexing for the `User` entity will be generated. For microservices, reindexing for every entity except the `User` entity will be generated.

```bash
yo jhipster-elasticsearch-reindexer
```

This will write all JHipster entities to a service that can be called through your API. This needs to be run any time you add or remove an entity to your project.

If you are using JHipster version **2.27.0** and above, a post-entity generation hook will be set that will automatically rerun `jhipster-elasticsearch-reindexer`. For JHipster **2.26.2** and below, `jhipster-elasticsearch-reindexer` needs to be rerun manually.

To call the generated service, you need to send a POST request to `api/elasticsearch/index`. Example:

```bash
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Accept: text/plain" --header "X-CSRF-TOKEN: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" "http://localhost:8080/api/elasticsearch/index"
```
